# FinSight – Banking Intelligence Dashboard

## Project Overview
FinSight is an interactive Power BI dashboard project tailored for the banking and financial sector. It showcases skills in data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and cloud integration using Microsoft Azure. The dashboard provides insights into simulated banking transactions, enabling stakeholders to monitor transaction trends, channel usage, and transaction types.

## Features
- **Executive Overview:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) including Total Transactions, Total Value, Average Transaction Value, and Unique Customers.
- **Transaction Analysis:** Trend lines, channel breakdowns, and transaction type distributions with interactive slicers for date, channel, and transaction type.
- **Cloud Integration:** Demonstrates the use of Azure Blob Storage to host transaction data, simulating real-world cloud-based data pipelines.
- **Professional Documentation:** Includes business questions and project documentation to illustrate project management capabilities.

## Azure Cloud Integration
The transaction dataset is securely stored in an **Azure Blob Storage** container. Power BI connects directly to this Azure Blob URL, enabling real-time data refresh and dashboard updates. This setup reflects modern banking environments where financial data is ingested, stored, and analyzed in the cloud.

While this project currently uses a static CSV file uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, it represents foundational knowledge for building scalable, automated data pipelines using Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, or Azure SQL Database in future iterations.

## Files Included
- `FinSight_Banking_Dashboard_AzureConnected.pbix` – Power BI Desktop file connected to Azure Blob Storage.
- `BankingTransactions.csv` – Sample dataset used for simulation.
- Screenshots folder – Contains images showcasing the dashboard and Azure setup.
- `BusinessQuestions.md` – Document listing key business questions answered by this project.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning, modeling, and visualization in Power BI
- Use of DAX for calculated metrics and KPIs
- Integration with cloud storage (Azure Blob Storage)
- Interactive dashboard design with slicers and multiple pages
- Project documentation and presentation for professional portfolios
